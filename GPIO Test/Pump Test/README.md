# Initial code testing for pump

Both files run infinite loops. To exit loop use ``ctrl+C``. **Do not use ``ctrl+Z``**.

## pump-test.py

Code runs an infinite loop with the flow:

1. Both pumps forward for 1 second
2. Both pumps stopped for 1 second
3. Both pumps backward for 1 second
4. Both pumps stopped for 1 second


## pump-forward.py

1. Both pumps forward for 5 seconds
2. Both pumps stopped for 1 second
